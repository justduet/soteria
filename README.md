# Soteria

As the popularity of AI-assisted content creation has surged in recent years, a need has arisen for a centralized platform that enables creators to assert authorship over their works. Services that exist currently fail to provide means of registering, sharing, and recording the provenance of AI works. My artefact will be a web application that fills this gap. It will enable creators to protect their work and prepare for a future driven by AI and human collaboration.

This repository contains the code for the lambda function and plugin used to customize the Wordpress site and hash uploaded images.
It also contains the structure of the AWS managed MySQL database designed for this project.
